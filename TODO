### 2021-04-18 TYPESCRIPT EDITION

Typescript update: turn all of boltzmann into typescript. This lets us maintain
a single version of all files, then compile the typescript out for javascript
mode. Typescript also gives us a high-level pass on our compiled boltzmann.js
file for any given set of flags -- if it passes typescript it'll (probably)
work.

- [ ] add "setup for local boltzmann dev"
    - this should allow testing files with `tap` + typescript
    - to do this, we want to grab the package.json that would be generated for a new
      typescript project along with tsconfig & typings and put them in cwd
    - then `npm i`
- [ ] note missing defs from boltzmann.d.ts
    - "Next" is now "Handler"
    - "Response" does not exist / needs defined + exported I think
- [ ] implement hayes' middleware validation typedefs
- [ ] add tests to ALL FILES / make sure all features are working as expected (again, write tests!)
- [ ] render {% changelog %} correctly in docstrings
- [ ] fixup docstrings -- they currently don't show in editor!
- [ ] merge project files (no more ts and js variants; just treat it as one variant)
- [ ] fill in `HACKING.md`
- [ ] add test for "only production deps are installed" and make sure boltzmann still runs!
- [x] ensure devdeps are only required in dev mode
- [x] change "selftest" setup
    - "selftest" is kind of a misnomer now: there's "test in situ" – i.e., before
      concatenating a `boltzmann.ts` together – and "test compiled", which are integration
      tests against a compiled `boltzmann.ts`
- [x] post-process typescript to get to javascript mode
    - suggestion from ceej: move exports up to selftest blocks so we can transpile templates
    - transpiling templates:
        - ts is terrible at preserving comments, so "// {% if selftest %}" is now "void `{% if selftest %}`"
        - also it really wants to control import syntax
            - target module: ES2020, not CommonJS, then we'll rewrite the result (!!)
            - also "grep -v 'void ``'"
            - and turn off source maps
        - drops endifs from:
            - entrypoint
            - prelude
                - solution: break out export { } block
            - status
- [x] stretch goal: make it possible to run tap against the JS transpilation
- [x] add JS transpilation step to `build.rs`
- [x] docstrings -- pull from reference docs (somehow)

### 2020-12-10

- [ ] typescript support
  - [x] install tsconfig.json
  - [x] node -r tsnode/register
    - [x] add to run scripts
  - [-] build script
    - [ ] make sure it brings boltzmann.js in
  - options
    1. leave boltzmann as JS, generate TS for everything else <-- went this route
      1. write a declaration file if they'll let us
      2. somehow make it work without a declaration file
    2. rewrite boltzmann in TS, compile to JS on scaffolding for non-TS targets

CJ and Chris' type goals:

- autocomplete in editor is gold
- typechecking is good
  - but we don't like transpiling server services
    - debugging becomes harder -- what's checked into your repo is not what's running
    - language version becomes something you have to care about (compile target)
    - bitrot: typescript may be a fad
    - explodes the state space
    - as javascript experts, the juice is not worth the squeeze, so to speak
      - rust has better type inference
        - it's not an "infection" of a base language
        - perf/reliability guarantees
- we were asked to add typescript support (scaffolding a typescript project)



### 2020-12-04

- [x] documentation version picker
  - ideally fully static:

    - [x] test, if it doesn't exist
    - [x] boltzmann:upgrade, to upgrade the thing

- [x] maybe make "jwt middleware" a flag
- [x] pick a better linter and install it by default

### 2020-05-28

- [ ] improve tool output
    - answer the following: what does the user care about?
    - what changed. why it changed.
- [x] npm installs (and uninstalls HA HA HA)
- [x] make ping and status controlled by options
- [x] bake templates into CLI binary
- [ ] github releases of the tool
- [ ] release npx package (boltzmann and boltzmann-cli)

### EOD 2020-05-27

CEEJ expresses intent to push docs changes directly to master.
We'll regroup to add information architecture.

Code changes will be PR'd in.

- [ ] CHRIS: ~Add two subcommands: `init` and `update`.~ **Edit**: We ended up not doing this
- [x] CEEJ: detect git state of destination dir, respecting force flag
- [x] CHRIS: load existing package.json
    - [x] implement turning a thing off
- [x] attach "skip if present" data to Nodes (& skip creating them if they're present)
- [x] inspect the flags and map them to npm actions
    - [x] run npm install in a subprocess
- [x] render our actual templates, for real
- [x] run the tests
    - [x] write a github CI action for this repo
- [ ] write a github CI action for releases
- [ ] finish off the docs
    - [ ] add more examples
- [ ] maybe make "jwt middleware" a flag
- [ ] pick a better linter and install it by default

### BOD 2020-05-27

- write the command-line tool lol.
- write examples
- Hide ajv by presenting a better facade for it.

Facts to make true:

- This is a rust tool
- it operates on `.`
- it takes its options as single-word arguments, with `--` in front of them optional
- mentioning a feature turns it on; `=off` removes the feature
- it generates a directory with some files in it
- it makes a package.json if none exists (npm -init -y)
- it installs its deps using bash to run npm
- it stores its options in package.json in the field `boltzmann`
- if you rerun it without options, it'll respect the ones in the package.json if found; cli options override the ones in package.json

`ludwig redis hc pg=off` scaffolds with redis and honeycomb, and turns off postgres.
