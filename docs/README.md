# Boltzmann documentation

This directory contains source for the Boltzmann documentation site. You can view it in development by running `bin/docs serve`. The docs are automatically built for each new tagged release. The build is available at [the documentation site](https://www.boltzmann.dev/en/docs/v0.1.9/). It is versioned but there is not yet a nice way to select a version.

You can always show the docs for the latest version of boltzmann by running `npx boltzmann-cli --docs`.
